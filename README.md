# HookUp-project_System-Documentation
This repository holds the system documentation of the dating application HookUp!, created as part of an academic project.

The HookUp!’s documentation is the result of complementary strengths of 6 Software Engineering students – including myself – that implemented a software development project from the scratch, under the Software Engineering program at Centennial College.

We designed, implemented, and documented the HookUp! application to simulate activities of the software engineering processing using the most common collaborative tools existent in the computer industry.

In summary, throughout this project, we have demonstrated the ability to:
- Gather requirements for the system
- Analyze and estimate the requirements applying Agile methodologies
- Apply Agile methodologies to solve design and implementation issues
- Design proper database structure
- Code and test
- Produce user and system documentation
- Produce reports and project status
